# Mini Project to do list
- [ ] Read the ChatGPT pdf, find the original unfixed rewards function 
- [ ] Train with this reward function to have a reference result
- [ ] Read and summary the paper link :
    Two papers that had a significant impact on this project:

    [1] [DIAMBRA Arena A New Reinforcement Learning Platform for Research and Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10595)
    The valuable summary of the experience in setting hyperparameters for deep reinforcement learning models in fighting games in this paper was of great help to the training process of this project.

    [2] [Mitigating Cowardice for Reinforcement Learning](https://ieee-cog.org/2022/assets/papers/paper_111.pdf)
    The "penalty decay" mechanism proposed in this paper effectively solved the "cowardice" problem (always avoiding opponents and not daring to even try attacking moves).
- [ ] Summary the normal reinforcement learning process 
- [ ] Train with ourselves to get result and try to plot the training curve 
- [ ] Additional try with other games( best same game type)
